# rubiks-cube-bld

Image processing application that identifies a cube's current permutation and then proceeds to provide step-by-step instructions for solving the cube. 

# Concept and Application Workflow
Identifies Rubik's Cube configuration for a side
Records side based on center color
Notifies user when identification is successful and to turn to the next side (repeat for all 6 sides)
Pushes cube data into solving algorithm
Outputs the steps needed to solve said cube alongside Visualizer

# Dependencies
openCV
